# Overview
In
The repository hosts the design and documentation of blood donation coordinating systems.
It is more about system analysis, workflows, and system architectures rather than a complete implementation.
## Problem Statement
Problems

Blood donation systems are prone to problems like delays, coordination issues, and actual time availability of donors.
This proposed system suggests a centralized approach towards enhancing donor-patient-hospital communication.

## Key Features
- Matching for blood type compatibility
- Location-Based Donor Discovery
- Hospital Verification
- Notification System
- Tracking the history of donations
- Role-based access (Role-Based Access - Donor/Patient/Hospital)
